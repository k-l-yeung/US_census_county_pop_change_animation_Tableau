### <a id='Overview'>1: Overview</a>

#### Motivation
To have **an interactive visual tour of** the change in estimated population in the US county level in the past 20 years through animated visulization.  The interactive visualization can be seen in my Tableau project [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kam.leung.yeung/viz/USCountyPopulationEstimateChangeBetween2000and2019/Dashboard1).  Below is a screenshot of the final presentation.

#### Method
Data from United States Census Bureau was acquired by downloading the related csv/excel files. The initial idea of acquiring data from [Population Estimates APIs](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/popest-popproj/popest.html) is not feasible due to the non-consecutive yearly estimate of the population at the county level.  

Data was prepared and summarized in pandas, and the exported data was fed to Tableau for creating the interactive visuals.
